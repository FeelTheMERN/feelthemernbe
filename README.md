# Background
A full stack developer needs to be able to demonstrate they can build a complete application from design through to deployment for a commercial client (using appropriate tools and methodologies). This project covers off many Diploma units of competency required for accreditation (see section 7 below).

# Description
You are to design, build, deploy and present a web application (App) built for a real world customer.

Find a business or organisation (preferably near your campus) to build an App for.

Meet with the business owner or organisation manager to find out what challenges they face. Find a problem that you can solve with an App and present your ideas to the client.

The project must be completed in the assigned groups.
