PROJECT MANAGEMENT 

- CLIENT INTERACTION 
 - Initial meeting...meet with Skye on...discussed her current business needs, clients, and the technologies she uses. We   
   discussed how an application could improve her 
   workflow and business in general. (See above: for her problems/solutions, and our project brief.)
   We followed up with her...
   Changes made to our initial plans. (see challenges: ) 

 - Second meeting: conceptual design and feedback  
 - * Show evidence of client communication, e.g. meeting minutes, emails, or other communication tools  

 - QUESTIONNAIRE FOR CLIENT 

 - SYSTEM TESTING (Prepare maintenance or support plans for client)   
 - TRELLO ( See: screenshots in 'Trello' folder)

SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS


1. What are the most important aspects of quality software?

    FUNCTIONAL, PROCESS and STRUCTURAL quality. 

    FUNCTIONAL quality means that the software correctly performs the tasks it's intended to do for its users. Among the     
    attributes of functional quality are:

    - Meeting the specified requirements 
    - Creating software that has few defects
    - Good enough performance 
    - Ease of learning and ease of use

    STRUCTURAL quality means that the code itself is well structured and allows: 

    - Code testability. Is the code organised in a way that makes testing easy?
    - Code maintainability. How easy is it to add new code or change existing code without introducing bugs? 
    - Code understandability. Is the code readable? Is it more complex than it needs to be?  These have a large impact on how 
      quickly new developers can begin working with an existing code base.
    - Code Effeciency. Especially in resource-constrained situations, writing effecient code can be critically important. 
    - Code security. Does the software allow common attacks such as buffer overruns and SQL injection. Is it insecure in other 
      ways?    

    PROCESS quality refers to the quality of the development process significantly affects the value received by users, 
    development teams, and sponsors, and so all three groups have a stake in improving this aspect of software quality. 

    - Meeting delivery dates. Was the software delivered on time?
    - Meeting budgets. Was the software delivered for the expected amount of money? 
 

2. What libraries are being used in the app and why?

* Axios: Provided a more convenient and readable syntax when making HTTP requests
* Body Parser: Important for accessing payloads (req.body) from POST, PUT and DELETE requests
* Bcrypt: Package that hashes passwords before being stored in the database for security
* Cloudinary: Permits users to upload images that is stored in the cloud
* Cookie-session: Allows for cookies which are used for authentication
* Cors: Allows the client to communicate with the API without issue
* Dotenv: Essential for storing sensitive data (keys, secrets) in environmental variables
* Express: Framework for the backend
* JSONWEBTOKEN: Authentication with tokens, an added layer of security on top of cookies
* Moment: A convenient library for reading date formats
* Mongoose: Used to generate models which interacts with the database
* Multer: Allows for temporary in-memory storage before uploading to Cloudinary
* Nodemon: Convenient dev package that restarts the server when alterations are made
* Now: We used now.sh to deploy our backend application
* Passport: Important middleware responsible for authenticating username and password

3. A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?

4. Within your own project what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and overcome challenges?
