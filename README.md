### What are the most important aspects of quality software?

* Identifying and solving user stories
* Continual and automated testing is integral to ensure smooth performance
* Ensure design and framework is robust yet flexible for future changes
* Frequent communication with the client and assessing feedback
* Keeping the code DRY, re-use components as much as possible
* Writing comments when appropriate
* Ensure functions are suitable and accurate, and functions handling sensitive data are secure and compliant to relevant guidelines

### What libraries are being used in the app and why?

* Axios: Provided a more convenient and readable syntax when making HTTP requests
* Body Parser: Important for accessing payloads (req.body) from POST, PUT and DELETE requests
* Bcrypt: Package that hashes passwords before being stored in the database for security
* Cloudinary: Permits users to upload images that is stored in the cloud
* Cookie-session: Allows for cookies which are used for authentication
* Cors: Allows the client to communicate with the API without issue
* Dotenv: Essential for storing sensitive data (keys, secrets) in environmental variables
* Express: Framework for the backend
* JSONWEBTOKEN: Authentication with tokens, an added layer of security on top of cookies
* Moment: A convenient library for manipulating date formats
* Mongoose: Used to generate models which interacts with the database
* Multer: Allows for temporary in-memory storage before uploading to Cloudinary
* Nodemon: Convenient dev package that restarts the server when alterations are made
* Now: We used now.sh to deploy our backend application
* Passport: Important middleware responsible for authenticating username and password
